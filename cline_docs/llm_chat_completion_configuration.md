# LLM Chat Completion Script Configuration

## Problem Statement

The hierarchical schematic generation in SKiDL is not properly maintaining parent-child relationships between circuits. While the circuit hierarchy is correctly tracked in the SKiDL Circuit object's group_name_cntr, the generated KiCad schematics show all circuits at the top level instead of maintaining proper nesting.

## Required Files for Analysis

Update the TARGET_FILES list in llm_chat_completion_script.py to include:

```python
TARGET_FILES = [
    # Core Generation Files
    'gen_schematic_v8.py',      # Main schematic generation logic
    'kicad_writer.py',          # KiCad schematic file writer
    
    # Test Files
    'test_circuits.py',         # Shows the circuit hierarchy issue
    'test_nested_project.py',   # Reference test for nested projects
    
    # Generated Schematics
    'single_resistor.kicad_sch',       # Parent circuit schematic
    'two_resistors_circuit.kicad_sch', # Child circuit schematic
    'testing_hierarchy.kicad_sch',     # Main project schematic
]
```

## Introduction Message

Update the INTRO_MESSAGE to include:

```python
INTRO_MESSAGE = """The following files are part of a hierarchical schematic generation issue in SKiDL:

Core Files:
- gen_schematic_v8.py: Main schematic generation logic that processes circuit hierarchy
- kicad_writer.py: Handles writing KiCad schematic files and sheet symbols
- test_circuits.py: Demonstrates the hierarchical circuit issue with nested resistor circuits

Test Files:
- test_nested_project.py: Reference implementation for proper nested project handling

Generated Schematics:
- single_resistor.kicad_sch: Parent circuit containing one resistor and calling child circuit
- two_resistors_circuit.kicad_sch: Child circuit containing two resistors
- testing_hierarchy.kicad_sch: Main project schematic showing incorrect hierarchy

Current Issue:
The SKiDL Circuit object correctly tracks hierarchy in group_name_cntr:
{
    'top.single_resistor': 1,
    'top.single_resistor0.two_resistors_circuit': 1
}

However, the generated KiCad schematics show both circuits at the top level instead of maintaining the parent-child relationship where two_resistors_circuit should be nested under single_resistor.

Key Areas to Analyze:
1. Hierarchy tracking in Circuit object
2. Sheet symbol creation in gen_schematic_v8.py
3. Project configuration updates for proper sheet paths
4. KiCad schematic file structure for hierarchical sheets

Terminal Output:
[Include the relevant terminal output showing the issue]
"""
```

## File Organization

The script should:

1. Collect all relevant files from the project directory
2. Include both source code and generated schematics
3. Preserve file paths and relationships
4. Include terminal output showing the issue

## Analysis Goals

The combined output should help analyze:

1. How circuit hierarchy is tracked in SKiDL
2. How sheet symbols are currently created
3. Where the hierarchy information is lost
4. What changes are needed to maintain proper nesting

## Next Steps

After running the script:

1. Review the collected code and schematics
2. Analyze the hierarchy handling in gen_schematic_v8.py
3. Compare with reference implementation in test_nested_project.py
4. Develop solution for proper hierarchical sheet creation

## Implementation Notes

1. Use absolute paths based on ROOT_DIRECTORY
2. Include file headers and separators for clarity
3. Preserve all relevant context and debugging output
4. Structure the output to clearly show the hierarchy issue
