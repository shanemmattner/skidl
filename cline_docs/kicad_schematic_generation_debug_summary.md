# KiCad Schematic Generation Debug Summary

## Current Situation

The test `test_schematic_generation` in `test_one_resistor.py` is failing because:
1. The generated schematic has an empty lib_symbols section
2. The test expects the lib_symbols section to contain the Device:R symbol definition
3. The debug_schematic_generation.py script works, but the test fails

## Key Files to Examine

1. **KiCad Symbol Loading**
   - `src/skidl/tools/kicad8/sch_gen/kicad_writer.py`
     - Contains KicadSchematicWriter class
     - Responsible for loading symbols and generating schematics
     - Currently tries to load symbols from KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR

2. **Symbol Definition Generation**
   - `src/skidl/tools/kicad8/sch_gen/symbol_definitions.py`
     - Contains SymbolDefinition class
     - Used to represent KiCad symbols in memory

3. **Library Parsing**
   - `src/skidl/tools/kicad8/sch_gen/kicad_library_parser.py`
     - Responsible for parsing .kicad_sym files
     - May need debugging to see if it's correctly loading symbols

4. **Test Files**
   - `src/skidl/tools/kicad8/sch_gen/tests/test_one_resistor.py`
     - Contains failing test
     - Has reference schematic for comparison
   - `src/skidl/tools/kicad8/sch_gen/tests/reference_schematics/one_resistor.kicad_sch`
     - Contains expected schematic output

5. **Debug Script**
   - `debug_schematic_generation.py`
     - Working example that successfully generates a schematic
     - Compare its execution path with the test

## Possible Next Steps

1. **Debug Symbol Loading**
   - Add debug logging in KicadLibraryParser.load_library()
   - Print the actual path being used to load Device.kicad_sym
   - Verify the symbol file exists and is readable

2. **Compare Working vs Failing Paths**
   - Add logging to debug_schematic_generation.py to see how it finds symbols
   - Compare environment variables and paths between debug script and test
   - Check if Part("Device", "R", ...) uses a different method to find symbols

3. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Consider bundling a minimal Device.kicad_sym with test fixtures
   - Extract symbol definition from reference schematic for testing
   - Add configuration to override symbol search paths in tests

4. **Symbol Generation Investigation**
   - Debug _flatten_symbol() in KicadSchematicWriter
   - Verify symbol flattening logic works correctly
   - Check if symbol inheritance is handled properly

5. **Test Environment Setup**
   - Review how KiCad paths are determined in test environment
   - Consider adding setup/teardown fixtures for KiCad environment
   - Add validation for required KiCad files before tests run

## Questions to Answer

1. How does debug_schematic_generation.py find the Device.kicad_sym file?
2. What's the difference in symbol loading between test and debug environments?
3. Should we bundle test symbols instead of depending on KiCad installation?
4. Is the symbol flattening logic working correctly?
5. Are we handling the KiCad environment setup properly in tests?

## Next Investigation Steps

1. Add debug logging to KicadLibraryParser:
```python
def load_library(self) -> None:
    print(f"Attempting to load library: {self.libfile}")
    if not os.path.isfile(self.libfile):
        print(f"Library file not found: {self.libfile}")
        print(f"Working directory: {os.getcwd()}")
        print(f"KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR: {os.environ.get('KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR')}")
```

2. Add symbol path logging to Part constructor:
```python
def __init__(self, lib, name, **kwargs):
    print(f"Creating part {lib}:{name}")
    print(f"Library search paths: {self.get_search_paths()}")
```

3. Compare symbol paths between environments:
```python
def print_environment():
    print("KiCad Environment:")
    print(f"KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR: {os.environ.get('KICAD_SYMBOL_DIR')}")
    print(f"Working Directory: {os.getcwd()}")
    print(f"Python Path: {sys.path}")
