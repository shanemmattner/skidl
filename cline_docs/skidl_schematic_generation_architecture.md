# SKiDL Schematic Generation Architecture

## Overview
The schematic generation process in SKiDL involves transforming a circuit description into a KiCad schematic representation.

## Key Components
1. **Circuit Representation**
   - Managed by SKiDL's `Circuit` class
   - Contains parts, connections, and hierarchical information

2. **Schematic Writer**
   - `KicadSchematicWriter` handles low-level schematic file generation
   - Responsible for converting circuit components to schematic symbols

3. **Kiutils Integration**
   - Uses `kiutils.schematic.Schematic` for advanced schematic manipulation
   - Provides methods for creating, loading, and saving schematics

## Architectural Challenges
- Handling multiple subcircuits
- Maintaining component positioning
- Managing hierarchical relationships
- Ensuring consistent symbol representation

## Design Principles
1. Modularity: Each subcircuit generates its own schematic
2. Flexibility: Support for various component types
3. Reproducibility: Consistent symbol placement
4. Error Resilience: Graceful handling of generation failures

## Potential Improvements
- Enhanced error logging
- More configurable symbol placement
- Better handling of complex hierarchical designs
- Improved library symbol mapping

## Performance Considerations
- Memory efficiency for large circuits
- Minimizing file I/O operations
- Optimizing symbol generation algorithms

## Recommended Best Practices
- Use consistent library references
- Validate circuit before generation
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Maintain clean separation between circuit logic and schematic generation
