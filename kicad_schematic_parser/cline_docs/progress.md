# Project Progress and Milestones

## Recent Achievements
### Component Deduplication Enhancement
- Implemented hash-based duplicate detection strategy
- Introduced `generate_component_hash()` method
- Created `seen_hashes` set for efficient tracking of unique components
- Improved duplicate detection accuracy and performance

## Deduplication Strategy Details
- Moved beyond simple reference-based duplicate detection
- Considers multiple component attributes for comprehensive uniqueness check
- Provides more robust handling of complex schematic scenarios

## Performance Improvements
- Constant-time complexity for duplicate detection
- Minimal computational overhead
- Scalable approach for large schematic parsing

## Documentation Updates
- Updated `componentParsing.md` with new deduplication strategy
- Enhanced component parser README with implementation details
- Added comprehensive documentation of hash-based approach

## Future Development Directions
- Explore configurable hash generation strategies
- Develop more advanced duplicate resolution mechanisms
- Implement enhanced diagnostic logging
- Optimize performance for increasingly complex schematics
