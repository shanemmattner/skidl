# Project Progress

## Completed Features
### KiCad to Text Conversion
- [x] Component extraction with detailed properties
- [x] Pin position calculation
- [x] Wire connection analysis
- [x] Label parsing (local, hierarchical, power)
- [x] Net connectivity analysis
- [x] Support for hierarchical sheets

### SKiDL Generator
- [x] Component Parser
  * Parse component names
  * Extract component properties
  * Validate component data format
  * Handle library and component name parsing

## In Progress
### Text to SKiDL Conversion
- [ ] Pin Parsing
  * Track pin electrical types
  * Manage pin positions
  * Handle pin-to-pin connections

- [ ] Net Parsing
  * Parse net names and connections
  * Handle power, local, and hierarchical nets
  * Track net connectivity

- [ ] Sheet Parsing
  * Parse sheet definitions and boundaries
  * Manage sheet properties and metadata
  * Track parent-child sheet relationships

- [ ] Hierarchy Building
  * Construct complete circuit hierarchy
  * Resolve cross-sheet connections

- [ ] Code Generation
  * Generate SKiDL Python code
  * Create subcircuit functions
  * Handle component instantiation

## Known Limitations
- Labels placed in the middle of a wire may not be detected
- Label transfer between connections might be incomplete
- Incomplete information extraction (missing position and UUID)

## Development Priorities
1. Improve Information Extraction
   - Add position tracking for components
   - Capture UUID for components
   - Enhance label detection mechanisms

2. Testing and Validation
   - Develop comprehensive test suite
   - Verify existing functionality
   - Cover edge cases in parsing logic

3. Project Improvements
   - Rename project components for clarity
   - Integrate hierarchy logic parser
   - Update documentation
   - Prepare for KiCad project import

## Potential Edge Cases to Address
- Handling labels in the middle of nets
- Parsing logic for complex schematic structures
- Compatibility with various KiCad schematic designs

## Next Steps
1. Enhance test coverage
2. Improve parsing robustness
3. Implement missing information extraction
4. Develop subsequent parsing modules
5. Prepare for SKiDL code generation
