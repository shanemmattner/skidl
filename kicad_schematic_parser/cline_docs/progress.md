## Net Parsing Development Progress

### Completed
- Implemented net parsing test infrastructure
- Resolved import and path resolution issues
- Created test cases for:
  * Resistor divider circuit
  * Multi-rail power supply

### Test Coverage
| Schematic | Status | Coverage Details |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| resistor_divider | ✓ | Basic net formation, label priority |
| power2 | ✓ | Multi-rail power distribution |

### Current Challenges
- Ensuring consistent path resolution
- Handling complex hierarchical schematic structures
- Improving net connectivity tracing

### Upcoming Milestones
1. Expand test scenarios
2. Implement more advanced net parsing logic
3. Add support for more complex circuit topologies
4. Enhance error reporting and debugging

### Known Limitations
- Current parsing may miss subtle label connections
- Limited support for complex hierarchical designs
- Potential edge cases in multi-sheet schematics

### Performance Metrics
- Test execution time
- Memory usage during parsing
- Accuracy of net formation
