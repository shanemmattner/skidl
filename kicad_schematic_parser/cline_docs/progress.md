## Net Parsing Improvements Progress

### Completed
- Identified net naming priority issues
- Established test infrastructure
- Developed test matrix covering key scenarios

### Test Coverage
| Schematic | Status | Coverage Details |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| resistor_divider | ✓ | Basic net formation, label priority |
| power2 | ✓ | Multi-rail power distribution |
| stm32 | ✓ | Hierarchical sheet connections |

### Current Challenges
- Import module resolution in test suite
- Finalizing net naming algorithm
- Ensuring cross-sheet label propagation

### Upcoming Milestones
1. Resolve test import issues
2. Complete net naming priority implementation
3. Validate recursive connectivity tracing
4. Refactor net parsing module for improved modularity
5. Expand test coverage with additional edge cases

### Known Limitations
- Current parsing may misidentify power vs hierarchical labels
- Incomplete connectivity analysis across sheet boundaries

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize recursive tracing algorithm
- Minimize computational overhead in net formation
