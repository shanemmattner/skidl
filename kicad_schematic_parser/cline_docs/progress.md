## Project Progress

### Current Development Phase
- Phase: Component Parsing and Validation
- Status: Advanced
- Goal: Robust component parsing and preparation for net connectivity

### Completed Milestones
- Comprehensive component parsing implementation
- Successful parsing of component attributes
- Robust test coverage for component parsing

### Current Challenges
- Handling duplicate components
- Preparing for net connectivity parsing
- Enhancing validation mechanisms

### Next Development Focus
1. Component Deduplication
   - Implement logic to identify and handle duplicate components
   - Create test cases for component uniqueness
   - Develop strategies for managing component duplicates

2. Net Parsing Preparation
   - Design infrastructure for tracking component relationships
   - Develop parsing strategy for net connections
   - Create comprehensive test scenarios for net parsing

3. Validation Enhancements
   - Extend component attribute validation
   - Implement stricter checks for required/optional fields
   - Improve error handling for edge cases

### Technical Debt and Improvements
- Refactor component parsing to handle complex scenarios
- Develop more granular error reporting
- Prepare for SKiDL code generation integration

### Test Coverage
- Component Parsing: âœ… Comprehensive
- Deduplication: ðŸ”œ Pending
- Net Parsing: ðŸ”œ In Planning
