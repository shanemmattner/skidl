## Project Progress

### Current Development Phase
- Phase: Component Parsing and Validation
- Status: Advanced
- Goal: Robust component parsing and preparation for net connectivity

### Completed Milestones
- Comprehensive component parsing implementation
- Successful parsing of component attributes
- Robust test coverage for component parsing
- Implemented duplicate component detection and warning system

### Current Challenges
- Preparing for net connectivity parsing
- Enhancing validation mechanisms
- Refining component deduplication strategy

### Next Development Focus
1. Net Parsing Preparation
   - Design infrastructure for tracking component relationships
   - Develop parsing strategy for net connections
   - Create comprehensive test scenarios for net parsing

2. Validation Enhancements
   - Extend component attribute validation
   - Implement stricter checks for required/optional fields
   - Improve error handling for edge cases

3. Component Deduplication
   - Refine duplicate detection logic
   - Develop more sophisticated matching criteria
   - Create configurable duplicate handling strategies

### Technical Debt and Improvements
- Optimize component parsing performance
- Enhance logging and error reporting mechanisms
- Develop more comprehensive test coverage
- Prepare for SKiDL code generation integration
