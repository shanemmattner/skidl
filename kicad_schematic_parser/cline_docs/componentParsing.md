# Component Parsing and Deduplication

## Overview
This document captures the implementation details of our component parsing strategy, with a focus on handling duplicate components.

## Parsing Strategy
- Components are parsed from KiCad schematic files
- Parsing includes:
  * Library and component name extraction
  * Properties parsing (Reference, Value, Footprint, etc.)
  * Position and angle information

## Duplicate Component Handling
### Detection Mechanism
- New hash-based deduplication strategy using `generate_component_hash()`
- `seen_hashes` set tracks unique component instances
- Duplicate detection occurs during parsing
- Logging and warning system for duplicate components

### Duplicate Rules
- Components are considered duplicates if they generate the same hash
- First occurrence of a unique component hash is preserved
- Subsequent components with the same hash trigger:
  * Warning log message
  * ParseResult error addition
  * Preservation of first component's details

### Hashing Strategy
- `generate_component_hash()` creates a unique identifier for each component
- Considers key attributes:
  * Library name
  * Component name
  * Key properties (Reference, Value, Footprint)
- Provides more robust duplicate detection compared to reference-based approach

### Logging
- Uses Python's `logging` module
- Warning level logging
- Timestamp and detailed message for each duplicate
- Includes hash information for precise tracking

## Implementation Details
- Located in: `src/skidl_generator/component_parser/component_parser.py`
- Key methods:
  * `parse_component_block()`
  * `parse_component_name()`
  * `parse_component_properties()`
  * `generate_component_hash()`

## Future Improvements
- Configurable hash generation strategies
- Customizable hash depth and attributes
- Performance optimization for hash generation
- Advanced duplicate resolution mechanisms
- Enhanced logging and reporting with hash diagnostics
