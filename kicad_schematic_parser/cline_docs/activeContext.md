## Current Development Focus

### Component Parsing
- Currently verifying component parsing functionality
- Next step: Ensure component parsing is robust and working correctly
- Located in: `src/skidl_generator/component_parser/`

### Development Stage
- All unit tests for KiCad hierarchy parsing are passing
- Moving to next phase of parsing hierarchy text output
- Focusing on component parsing to maintain existing functionality

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Review and validate component parsing code
2. Run existing unit tests for component parsing
3. Prepare for integration with hierarchy parsing
