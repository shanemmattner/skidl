## Current Focus: Net Parsing Test Infrastructure

### Recent Improvements
- Resolved import and path resolution issues in net parsing tests
- Enhanced schematic parsing fixture for robust testing
- Improved error handling and debugging in test module

### Key Objectives
1. Validate net parsing across different schematic scenarios
2. Ensure robust handling of:
   - Resistor divider circuits
   - Multi-rail power supply configurations
3. Implement comprehensive test coverage

### Test Scenarios
- Resistor Divider Test
  * Verify net formation
  * Check pin connectivity
  * Validate label propagation

- Power Supply Test
  * Multi-voltage rail analysis
  * Ground network verification
  * Power label tracking

### Next Steps
- Expand test matrix with additional schematic examples
- Refine net parsing algorithm
- Improve error reporting and debugging capabilities
