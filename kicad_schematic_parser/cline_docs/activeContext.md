## Current Development Focus

### Simplicity-Driven Approach
- Prioritize basic functionality
- Incremental feature development
- Minimal complexity in implementation

### Next Development Steps
1. Validate existing component parsing tests
2. Ensure robust error handling
3. Prepare for minimal viable integration

### Guiding Principles
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Focus on core parsing capabilities
- Avoid premature optimization

### Short-Term Goals
- Maintain current test coverage
- Refine existing parsing logic
- Prepare for basic net and hierarchy parsing integration
