# KiCad Schematic Parser System Architecture

## Core Parsing Components
1. Component Parser
   - Responsible for extracting component details
   - Calculates absolute pin positions
   - Handles symbol definitions

2. Net Parser
   - Tracks connectivity between components
   - Identifies and labels network connections
   - Resolves net relationships

3. Wire Parser
   - Interprets wire connections in schematic
   - Maps wire segments and junctions
   - Supports hierarchical and local connections

## Key Parsing Strategies
- Use of coordinate transformations
- Support for rotated and mirrored components
- Natural sorting of pin numbers
- Handling of multi-unit components

## Parsing Workflow
1. Extract schematic symbols
2. Calculate pin positions
3. Identify net connections
4. Generate comprehensive component and net information

## Current Challenges
- Accurate pin position calculation
- Handling component rotations
- Resolving complex net connections
- Supporting various KiCad schematic formats

## Design Principles
- Modular architecture
- Flexible parsing approach
- Robust error handling
- Comprehensive test coverage
