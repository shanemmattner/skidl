## Net Parsing Architecture

### Parsing Strategy
- Hierarchical, recursive net tracing
- Priority-based label resolution
- Comprehensive connectivity analysis

### Key Design Principles
1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
   - Minimal, focused parsing logic
   - Clear, understandable code structure

2. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
   - Implement only currently required functionality
   - Avoid over-engineering

3. **SOLID Principles**
   - Single Responsibility: Separate parsing concerns
   - Open/Closed: Extensible parsing framework
   - Dependency Inversion: Loose coupling between components

### Net Naming Priority Hierarchy
```
1. Sheet Pins
2. Hierarchical Labels
3. Power Labels
4. Local Labels
5. Generated ID
```

### Connectivity Analysis Approach
- Recursive wire/pin traversal
- Cross-sheet label propagation
- Multi-level net formation algorithm

### Parsing Components
- Label Parser: Extract and categorize labels
- Wire Parser: Trace wire connections
- Component Parser: Analyze component pins
- Net Parser: Combine information into comprehensive netlist

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing or ambiguous connections
- Logging of parsing anomalies
- Configurable verbosity levels

### Extensibility Considerations
- Modular design for easy algorithm updates
- Plugin-style architecture for custom parsing rules
- Support for future KiCad schematic format changes
