## KiCad Schematic Parsing Architecture

### Recent Changes
- Adapted test suite to accommodate evolving kiutils library structure
- Emphasized flexibility in symbol and component parsing
- Maintained consistent parsing approach across different schematic representations

### Key Architectural Patterns
- Dynamic mock object creation for testing
- Flexible symbol and component identification
- Support for multiple library and symbol configurations

### Parsing Strategies
- Use of libraryNickname and entryName for precise symbol matching
- Handling of different pin and component representations
- Robust error handling and validation

### Future Considerations
- Continued alignment with kiutils library updates
- Expanding test coverage for edge cases
- Improving parsing flexibility and robustness
