## Introduction

Cline is an autonomous coding agent that integrates directly into your IDE, capable of creating and editing files, executing commands, and managing development tasks with user oversight. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants, Cline operates as a collaborative partner in the development process, combining AI capabilities with human insight to tackle complex software development challenges.

## Core Concepts

### Key Features

1. **Plan/Act Mode Toggle**
   - Plan mode for architecture and design
   - Act mode for implementation
   - Seamless switching between modes
   - Integrated planning and execution

2. **Checkpoints System**
   - Workspace snapshots at each step
   - Compare changes between versions
   - Restore to previous states
   - Safe exploration of alternatives

3. **Auto-approve Features**
   - Configurable autonomous operations
   - File and directory access control
   - Terminal command execution
   - API request limits
   - System notifications

4. **Diff Editing**
   - Smart handling of large files
   - Search & replace capabilities
   - Targeted code modifications
   - Prevention of code deletion issues

### Philosophy of AI-Assisted Development

The core philosophy behind effective Cline usage is understanding that AI assistance isn't about complete automation, but rather about creating a synergy between human insight and AI capabilities. The most effective workflows embrace this collaborative approach, using structured processes and clear communication to achieve optimal results.

### Context Management

One of the most crucial aspects of working with Cline is effective context management. Key considerations include:

- Context limits: Conversations tend to degrade in quality after approximately 2 million tokens
- Fresh sessions: Start new sessions for implementation phases
- Explicit file access: Ensure Cline has access to all relevant source files

## Getting Started

[Section will be expanded based on additional information about basic setup and configuration]

## Key Features

### Plan/Act Mode

Introduced in v3.2.0, the Plan/Act mode toggle transforms how you interact with Cline:

#### Plan Mode
- Turns Cline into a software architect
- Gathers information about requirements
- Asks clarifying questions
- Designs comprehensive solutions
- Creates implementation plans

#### Act Mode
- Executes the planned solutions
- Implements code changes
- Follows the established architecture

### Checkpoints System

Cline maintains snapshots of your workspace:

- **Compare**: View differences between snapshots and current workspace
- **Restore Options**:
  - Restore Task and Workspace
  - Restore Task Only
  - Restore Workspace Only

### Auto-approve Features

Customize Cline's autonomy levels:

- File and directory reading
- File editing
- Terminal command execution
- Browser usage
- MCP server interaction
- API request limits
- System notifications for required attention

### Diff Editing

Cline utilizes smart diff editing for large files:

- Search & replace diff format for targeted edits
- Prevents code deletion issues
- Falls back to whole file editing when appropriate

## Best Practices

### File Management and Organization
1. **Keep Files Small**
   - Maintain files under 200-300 lines of code
   - Regularly refactor and extract components
   - Split large files into smaller, focused modules
   - Extract inline SVGs into separate icon components

2. **Version Control Discipline**
   - Commit working versions frequently
   - Use git commits as safety checkpoints
   - Make commits before major refactoring
   - Utilize Cline's checkpoint system for additional safety

3. **Project Structure**
   - Create a `.clinerules` file in your project root
   - Document project-specific behaviors and conventions
   - Include architectural context and documentation links
   - Define common patterns and import conventions

### Test-Driven Development with Cline

1. **Setting Up Tests First**
   - Start by writing test specifications before implementation
   - Define clear acceptance criteria and edge cases
   - Use tests to constrain Cline's implementation choices
   - Include example test cases in your initial prompt

2. **Test-First Workflow**
   ```markdown
   1. Write a failing test
   2. Ask Cline to implement the minimum code to pass
   3. Request refactoring while maintaining test coverage
   4. Repeat for next feature
   ```

3. **Testing Best Practices**
   - Keep test files alongside source code
   - Maintain consistent testing patterns
   - Use test coverage reports to guide implementation
   - Let Cline suggest additional test cases

4. **Benefits of TDD with Cline**
   - Clearer goals lead to more accurate implementations
   - Prevents scope creep and overengineering
   - Provides immediate feedback on implementation
   - Easier to maintain and refactor code
   - Helps contain Cline's implementation within specified boundaries

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

1. **Core MCP Tools**
   - Browser interaction capabilities
   - File system operations
   - Terminal command execution
   - Custom tool creation

2. **Creating Custom MCP Tools**
   - Use "add a tool that..." command
   - Create tools for specific workflows
   - Integrate with external services
   - Extend Cline's capabilities

3. **Effective MCP Usage**
   - Combine multiple tools for complex tasks
   - Use sequential thinking for step-by-step processes
   - Cross-reference search results from different tools
   - Monitor tool performance and token usage

### Structured Development Process

1. **Start with Clear Goals**
   - Begin with simple, clear explanations
   - Share initial thoughts on approach
   - Provide relevant context

2. **Question-Driven Development**
   - Encourage Cline to ask clarifying questions
   - Use questions to uncover edge cases
   - Build deeper understanding through dialogue

3. **Solution Exploration**
   - Request multiple approaches
   - Evaluate trade-offs
   - Make informed decisions

4. **Implementation Planning**
   - Create comprehensive documentation
   - Include architectural decisions
   - Provide code examples
   - Reference existing code

### Test-Driven Development with Cline

## Project Configuration

### .clinerules File

Create a root-level .clinerules file to:
- Define project-specific behaviors
- Set coding conventions
- Point to important documentation
- Provide architectural context
