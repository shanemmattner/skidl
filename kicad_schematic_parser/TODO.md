- kicad to hierarchy text isn't getting all the information we need.  We need the position and uuid as well most likely
- let's confirm everything is still working right.  Make some good tests for all the features, and make sure everything we've made is lock-tight before going forward
- integrate the hierachy logic parser as an option for the main logic, so we don't have to make one off scripts for exercising the functionality
- review all the code and have a good plan.  Next should be sheets or connections.  work with Cline to come up with a good plan.  keep everything simple
- start executing on the plan to implement features to import the example kicad project into skidl
- start thinking of edge cases for import
  - like we know that labels in the middle of nets don't register as part of the net
    - There might be some bugs in goofy parsing logic as well
- re-name parts of the project to make thier responsibilities more clear
- make sure readme's are updated
