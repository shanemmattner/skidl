# Component Parser

## Overview
A robust parser for extracting and processing component information from KiCad schematics.

## Key Features
- Robust component parsing from KiCad schematics
- Extraction of component properties
- Advanced hash-based duplicate detection

## Duplicate Detection Strategy
- Implements `generate_component_hash()` method for unique component identification
- Uses `seen_hashes` set to track unique component instances
- Considers multiple attributes for comprehensive duplicate detection:
  * Library name
  * Component name
  * Reference
  * Value
  * Footprint
- Provides more granular and reliable duplicate detection compared to traditional reference-based methods

## Hash Generation Process
1. Collect key component attributes
2. Generate a consistent hash using these attributes
3. Check against `seen_hashes` set
4. Log and handle duplicates accordingly

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient hash generation with minimal computational overhead
- Constant-time lookup for duplicate detection
- Scalable approach for large and complex schematics

## Implementation Location
- Primary implementation: `component_parser.py`
- Key methods:
  * `generate_component_hash()`
  * `process_text_to_skidl()`

## Logging and Error Handling
- Comprehensive logging of duplicate component detection
- Warnings generated for duplicate components
- Preservation of first encountered component details

## Future Improvements
- Configurable hash generation strategies
- Enhanced duplicate resolution mechanisms
- Performance optimizations
- More detailed diagnostic logging
